# Pandas-DataFrames-and-Data-Exploration 

---
## Project Overview
This project entailed analyzing a dataset that contains posts of articles, the article titles and their URLs, the number of comments an article received after posting, and the total points the post has accumulated since its creation date. 
Pandas was used in the process to explore the data set in order to find out key data aspects such as: 
- The nature of the rows and their values
   - Getting the first five rows
   - Getting the last five rows
  
-  Geting the title column as pandas series and identifying the parameters in the dataset
-  Sourcing the number of rows and columns in the file
-  Other data exploration activities including
   -  Checking out for Duplicates and null values
   -  Getting the summary statistics for the dataframe
